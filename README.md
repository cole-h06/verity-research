# Project Verity

A credibility inference system for networks of conflicting claims. Verity models the relationship between sources and claims as a graph to estimate the credibility of every source and the confidence of every claim it asserts.

# Problem

As artificial intelligence systems and autonomous agents reason and execute complex tasks across digital environments using information collected from many sources, evaluating and verifying the credibility of information becomes highly important.

# Core Research Challenge

Source credibility and claim credibility depend on each other recursively.

A source becomes more credible if it consistently supports true claims.
A claim becomes more credible if it is supported by credible sources.

Without external ground truth, we often rely on agreement between sources as evidence of truth.

However, agreement is only evidence if the sources are independent. If sources copy one another, is it really agreement? Or is it just representing a single observation?

# Approach

Sources and claims form a bipartite graph. Each edge represents a source asserting a claim. Verity treats information as an interconnected network instead of a collection of independent observations.

</p>
The idea is to see whether credibility can emerge naturally through repeated movement across the graph.

Computing credibility is iterative and propagates over the graph. At each iteration step, each source distributes its credibility across all claims it asserts, and each claim in turn redistributes its support that it accumulated back to the asserting sources. The iterations repeat until the credibility vector reaches a steady state fixed point. Agreement weighting influences how much support each assertion contributes.

# Content-Agnostic Core

Verity does not interpret the strings or meaning of claims. The current implementation uses product specifications as a development dataset because they provide large-scale conflicting information from independent sources. In production, clients construct their own credibility graphs from any domain.

Verity operates purely on graph structure, receiving only source identifiers, claim identifiers, and the assertion relationships between them. This means the graph has already been parsed, normalized, deduplicated, canonicalized, and otherwise pre-processed before it is ingested by Verity.

For instance, a client application may determine that the following values are all equivalent assertions for the same claim:

## Current Status of Verity
(As of June 22, 2026)

## Dataset

- 24 sources
- 2,976 source claims (individual assertions collected from sources)
- 1,662 canonical claims (normalized claim nodes used in graph experiments)

## Recent Progress

- Built the first experimental credibility graph
- Built a preprocessing pipeline for graph experiments
- Measured source overlap across the graph
- Measured agreement and disagreement between sources
- Reduced claim fragmentation in the experimental dataset
- Identified isolated sources and sparsity issues
- Established a repeatable graph-building pipeline for experiments

## Open Questions

- How should agreement affect credibility?
- How should disagreement affect credibility?
- How should source copying be handled?
- How much overlap is enough?
