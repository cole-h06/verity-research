# Verity Benchmark

This is the directory containing the benchmark dataset used for developing the Verity credibility inference engine.

With this benchmark, you can experiment with:

- Credibility propagation
- Agreement weighting
- Source dependency modeling

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the project dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cole-h06/Verity.git
cd Verity

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the benchmark

From the project root, run:

```bash
python run_benchmark.py
```

## Tables

- `sources.csv` - source identifiers
- `claims.csv` - claim nodes
- `source_claims.csv` - source-specific values
- `assertions.csv` - edges connecting sources to claims

Product specifications are currently the benchmark being used for development as they provide large amounts of conflicting data published by independent sources. That said, the inference algorithms themselves are not limited by any specific domain and operate only on graph structure.
