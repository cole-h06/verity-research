# Experiment 4 - Fixed Point Convergence

Date: June 13, 2026

Current graph:

* 24 sources
* 12,783 claims
* 13,962 assertions

*Figure 1: Current assertion graph statistics and early convergence under uniform initialization.*

Current propagation:

```text
source -> claim -> source
```

We allow for each source to distribute its credibility across all claims it asserts.

The sequential process as is:

Claim support:

$$
c_j = \sum_i \frac{s_i}{d_i}
$$

where:

* (s_i) = source credibility
* (d_i) = number of claims made by source (i)

Then claims vote back onto sources:

$$
s_i' = \frac{1}{|C_i|}\sum_j c_j
$$

After each iteration we normalize:

$$
\sum_i s_i = 1
$$

Convergence metric:

$$
\Delta = \max_i |s_i^{(t+1)} - s_i^{(t)}|
$$

Ran two initializations:

* uniform
* random

Uniform converged after 97 iterations.

*Figure 3: Early iterations under random initialization begin from a different starting distribution.*

Random converged after 94 iterations.

*Figure 4: Random initialization also converges to a stable fixed point after 94 iterations.*

Final difference between solutions:

```text
2.37e-8
```

*Figure 5: The final solutions differ by only 2.37 × 10^-8.*

So at the moment it looks like we're converging to essentially the same fixed point regardless of initialization.

Unexpected result:

```text
bjs.com ≈ 0.99999996
```

while nearly every other source collapses toward zero.

Need to figure out whether this is:

* graph structure
* source degree effects
* duplicate information reinforcing itself
* missing disagreement propagation
* something wrong in the operator itself

Also, still haven't incorporated explicit disagreement yet. Will look into this...

Currently, agreement only adds support. Conflicting claims don't directly subtract credibility.

Next steps:

* claim-level disagreement
* damping or "teleportation"
* random walks directly on the bipartite graph
* product-scoped exclusivity
