# Project Verity

A credibility inference system for networks of conflicting claims. Verity models the relationship between sources and claims as a graph to estimate the credibility of every source and the confidence of every claim it asserts.

# Problem

As AI systems and autonomous agents make decisions and execute complex tasks using information gathered from across the web, evaluating the credibility of information becomes increasingly important.

# Core Challenge

Source credibility and claim credibility depend on each other recursively.

A source becomes credible if it consistently supports true claims.
A claim becomes credible if it is supported by credible sources.

# Approach

Sources and claims form a bipartite graph. Each edge represents a source asserting a claim. Verity treats information as an interconnected network rather than a collection of independent observations.

  <em>An animation of credibility propagation running on a small network of sources and claims. Node size represents inferred credibility, while edges represent assertions.</em>

The idea is to see whether credibility can emerge naturally through repeated movement across the graph.

You can think of it as a verifier traveling through the network at random: starting on one source then moving to the set of claims it asserts, then from those claims to it's other supporting sources, over and over again. Sources that consistently connect to credible claims will get revisited more often. Claims supported by credible sources also get revisited more often.

The current implementation focuses on product specifications as an initial testbed. However, the underlying framework is not specific to e-commerce. Any domain involving sources, claims, and disagreement can potentially be modeled using the same graph structure.

## Current Status of Verity

(As of June 13, 2026)

### Dataset

* 24 sources
* 12,783 canonical claims
* 13,962 assertions

### Recent Results

* Implemented iterative source-claim credibility propagation
* Tested both uniform and random initialization
* Both initializations converged to nearly identical solutions
* Maximum observed difference after convergence: 2.37e-8
* Evidence suggests the propagation operator converges to a stable fixed point
* Credibility currently collapses heavily onto bjs.com
* Explicit disagreement propagation has not yet been incorporated (soon to be accounted for)

### Current Questions

* Why does bjs.com dominate the fixed point?
* How should conflicting claims subtract credibility?
* How can dependence between sources be modeled?
* Should random walks with teleportation be introduced?
