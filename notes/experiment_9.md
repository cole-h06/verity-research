# Experiment 9 - Agreement Structure

Date: June 23, 2026

## Background

In earlier Verity iterations, a claim was defined as:

```text
(product_id, attribute, value)
```

With this schema, sources only connected when they asserted the exact same value.

This resulted in a highly sparse graph where almost every claim was only supported by one source.

In order to increase overlap between sources, we redefined claims in Experiment 7:

```text
(product_id, attribute)
```

Values are now stored only in `source_claims`.

This created two distinct layers:

```text
source_claims
```

A table for value-level assertions and disagreements.

```text
claims + assertions
```

The graph structure used by the verifier for its graph traversal.

## Goal

Determine how much agreement and disagreement there is between the sources after migrating to attribute-level claims.

This experiment is not intended to modify the credibility scores; instead it's measuring how agreement and disagreement are distributed throughout the graph.

## Method

The assertions were grouped by:

```text
(product_id, attribute)
```

For each group:

```text
largest agreeing value group
----------------------------
total assertions
```

Agreement score examples:

```text
[8, 8, 8]
agreement = 1.00
```

```text
[8, 8, 2]
agreement = 0.67
```

```text
[8, 4, 2]
agreement = 0.33
```

Presently, agreement is still source-independent - all sources contribute equally.

Example

Product:

```text
Lenovo Slim 3 Chromebook
196803504613
```

Observed assertions:

```text
bestbuy.com      -> cpu_cores = 8
energystar.gov   -> cpu_cores = 8
target.com       -> cpu_cores = 8
walmart.com      -> cpu_cores = 2
```

Agreement:

```text
3 / 4 = 0.75
```

At the graph layer:

```text
bestbuy.com      -> claim_1166
energystar.gov   -> claim_1166
target.com       -> claim_1166
walmart.com      -> claim_1166
```

Each source is now linked to the same canonical property despite disagreeing on the value claims.

Each source is now linked to the same canonical property, despite their differing value claims.

## Observations

Agreement and disagreement relationships are now visible throughout the graph.

The new representation allows:

* measurement of agreement
* measurement of disagreement
* inspection of conflicting source assertions
* comparison of source overlap and value overlap

These relationships were hidden under the previous claim definition because each value created a separate claim node.

## Current Limitation

Agreement is not yet part of credibility propagation.

The verifier only sees:

```text
source -> claim -> source
```

through assertion edges.

Disagreement is measured but not yet incorporated into the propagation process.

## Next Question

Possible directions include:

* rewarding agreement
* penalizing disagreement
* weighting claims by agreement strength
* separating competing value clusters
* modeling source dependence and copying

This is still an open research question I am exploring.
